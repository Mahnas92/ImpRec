# ImpRec - An Impact Recommender

ImpRec is a prototype tool supporting change impact analysis (CIA) developed as part of a research project at the Department of Computer Science at Lund University. The tool has been developed as a proof-of-concept of the potential benefits of reusing traceability from previously completed impact analyses. ImpRec is a recommendation system for software engineering (RSSE) that uses a combination of information retrieval-based trace recovery techniques and analysis of network structure to identify potential impact for a given tracker case.

- ImpRec has been evaluated in an industrial case study with two units of analysis in Sweden and India. The interview guides are available in the documentation folder.
- A  user manual is available in the Documentation folder. Note that ImpRec was released under the name CaseDigger in the industrial case study.
- The power of ImpRec lies in the semantic network, but the network from the publications is confidential information from a proprietary company. In order to use ImpRec, you need to extend the dummy data available in the "input" folder. The Xml structure should be slef-explanatory.
